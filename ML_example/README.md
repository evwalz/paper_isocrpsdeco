# Example: ML Benchmark Datasets

CRPS decomposition for uncertainty quantification methods presented in Block 2 of Table 6 in [EasyUQ paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08376.pdf) with corresponding [EasyUQ Repo](https://github.com/evwalz/easyuq). The methods are:

- Conformal prediction (CP)
- smooth CP
- EasyUQ 
- smooth EasyUQ
- Laplace
- MC Dropout
- Single gaussian
